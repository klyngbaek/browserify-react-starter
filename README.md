browserify-react-starter
========================

You may run into a limit on open files.  In your ~/.profile, set ulimit -n 2048

- `npm -g install browserify`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`
- in browser, go to localhost:8500

For some reason, I had to install these directly or optimist couldn't load these transitive dependencies

`npm install minimist wordwrap`

To run the watcher,

- `npm run watch`
